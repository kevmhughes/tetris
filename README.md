# Description
For the very few people who don't know how to play **Tetris** : 

Blocks of different shapes drop from the top of the screen. Each block is made up of four small squares arranged to make a larger square, an l-shape, an s-shape or a column. As the blocks fall they can be rotated or moved horizontally in order to tessalate them with others that have already fallen. When a horizontal line is completed, that line is "destroyed" giving you points and moving the rest of the fallen pieces down by one line. If a line remains incomplete, another line must be completed above it. The more lines that stand incomplete, the higher the blocks above them stack, reducing the space in which falling shapes can be manipulated. Eventually the blocks reach the top of the screen and the game ends. The statistics panel at the right of the screen shows what shapes of blocks will appear next. The higher the level, the faster the blocks fall and the more points destroyed lines are worth.
